The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of 
arraylistsÂ and to implement a switch statement. The switch statment 
is used with a user interface in which the user is prompted for a 
command from the given selection of commands, then the switch runs 
the desired command. The project also introduces the fundamentals of 
arraylists by implementing various methods relating to them such as a 
size method, methods concerning the elements of each object in the list, 
methods for adding and deleting objects from the list, and a find method.
