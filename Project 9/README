This project centered around class hierarchy and 
the way different classes interact with one another in a hierarchy. 
This included an abstract "CloudStorage" class that all of the other 
classes in the project extend. These other classes also included methods 
that interacted with their parent classes and demonstrated the various 
aspects of hierarchies. Test files and methods were also used for all of 
these classes.
