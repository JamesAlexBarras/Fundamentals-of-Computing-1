This project was a combination of a lot of aspects of previous projects. 
The main thing was a list of cloud storage objects that were read in from
a data file. These objects could be of any of the cloud types from the 
previous project, so a switch statement was needed to create the appropriate 
object. A custom comparator was also required to compare elements of cloud 
storage objects. There are also other methods 
pertaining to the list of cloud storage objects created from the data file.
